READ ME: before making this issue, make sure you aren’t being an idiot by reporting any of these things:
- not working on servers
  - Datapacks are server side, dummy. The server you’re trying to use it on doesn’t have it. The mod version does nothing on the client.
- the crits act weird
  - This is just the nature of datapacks
